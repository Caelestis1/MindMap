# Windows MindMap tool
## Overview
This is a basic MindMap tool that anyone can use, expand, update, change.  

It was written for my own personal use, and is provided here purely as a proof of concept,  
and to provide me with some version control.

## Starting Up
When the application starts there will be a central "node" in the middle called "Start".  
There will be a ring / circle around it, a bin icon in the bottom left, and icons for  
Save, Load, Help, and Exit.  

The help is just a page with the key shortcuts and what the different clicks do.
